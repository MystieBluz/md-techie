## Portfolio Assignment

My goal for this homework assignment was to create a web application from scratch and build a portfolio page that I can add to as this course progresses.

The portfolio showcases a brief bio along with my current skills, talents and a contact form.

I utilized html, css, javascript and git to complete this homework assignment.
